# CryptoMiner
A pygame incremental game about printing money
The code is written in Python and utilizes pygame and pygame-gui libraries to function.
There are four buttons on the bottom and 4 lines of text on top. When you press the buttons you increase your MPS(Money Per Second).
The game seems fairly simple but the modifications from the buttons are complicated amthematical equations so that you can freely play around with the game.
